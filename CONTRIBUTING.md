Thank you for considering contributing to the **Developer Communities List**! This repository aims to compile a diverse 
list of active developer communities worldwide. Your contributions will help developers connect, learn, and grow.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Add a New Community
- Check if the country of the community you want to add is already listed.
- If the country exists:
  - Find the relevant technology category (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Kotlin, etc.).
  - Add your community under the relevant category using the format below.
- If the country does not exist:
  - Create a new section for the country using the [template](https://github.com/LaraKraemer/developer-communities/blob/main/country_format_template.md) provided.

### 2. Community Entry Format
Use the following format to add a community:

```
* [Community Name & City](URL)
```

For example:

```
