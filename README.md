# Developer Communities List
This repository will eventually list a wide range of non-profit developer communities across Germany, Europe, and the world. As a junior developer, I experience first hand the massive value of being part a developer community. 

### What is a community? 

A community is a non-profit group of people who share common interests, goals, or values, and organize events to connect, learn, and grow together.

### Do you want to contribute, add an a active community? 

Great! You can follow the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/LaraKraemer/developer-communities/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and simply open a Pull Request (PR) to update the developer community list. Your contributions will help developers connect, learn, and grow with each other.

For developer conferences across the world,  I recommend saving [Aurelie Vache repo](https://github.com/scraly/developers-conferences-agenda).

Driven by the community for the community.
